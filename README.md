## DCF Valuation Methodology
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation approach involves:
1. Forecasting Unlevered Free Cash Flows: Projecting future free cash flows for FY2025-2029.
2. Terminal Value Calculation: Estimating the value beyond the explicit forecast period.
3. Discounting: Applying an appropriate discount rate (WACC) to calculate present values.
4. Enterprise Value Determination: Summing the present values of projected cash flows and terminal value.
5. Equity Value Calculation: Adjusting enterprise value for cash, debt, and minority interests.

### Key Formulas Used
1. Unlevered Free Cash Flow
UFCF = NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - Increase in NWC
Where:
- NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax) = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)
- D&A = Depreciation & Amortization
- CapEx = Capital Expenditures
- NWC = Net Working Capital

2. Terminal Value (Perpetuity Growth Method)
Terminal Value = UFCF₍ₙ₊₁₎ ÷ (WACC - g)
Where:
- UFCF₍ₙ₊₁₎ = Unlevered Free Cash Flow in the first year after the projection period
- WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital
- g = Long-term growth rate

3. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
WACC = [E/(D+E) × Cost of Equity] + [D/(D+E) × Cost of Debt × (1-Tax Rate)]
Where:
- E = Market value of equity
- D = Market value of debt
- Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × Market Risk Premium
- Cost of Debt = Company's borrowing rate

### Key Assumptions and Projections
#### Revenue Growth
- FY2025: 10.0% (continued post-COVID momentum)
- FY2026: 10.0% (sustained growth from new warehouse openings)
- FY2027: 9.0% (slight moderation in growth rate)
- FY2028: 7.0% (approaching maturity in key markets)
- FY2029: 5.0% (long-term sustainable growth rate)

#### Margin Assumptions
- COGS: 87.0% of revenue (consistent with historical performance)
- SG&A: 8.8% of revenue (slight efficiency improvements)
- Tax Rate: 21.0% (aligned with U.S. corporate tax rate)

### Capital Expenditure and Depreciation
- CapEx: 15.0% of beginning PP&E (supporting continued expansion)
- D&A: 7.6% of beginning PP&E (consistent with historical patterns)

### Working Capital Components
- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): 3.6 days
- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO): 30.9 days
- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO): 33.5 days

### WACC Calculation
- Risk-Free Rate: 3.1% (10-Year Treasury Yield as of Oct 2024)
- Market Risk Premium: 4.7% (based on historical equity premium)
- Levered Beta: 0.7 (reflecting Costco's lower volatility compared to the market)
- Cost of Equity: 6.4% (using CAPM)
- Cost of Debt: 2.3% (based on Costco's effective borrowing rate)
- Debt-to-Capital Ratio: 3.4% (reflecting Costco's conservative capital structure)
- Resulting WACC: 6.2%

### Terminal Growth Rate
- 3.0% (consistent with long-term inflation plus modest real growth)

![Sensitivity Table](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acc9898b-033c-406b-b5f7-1b36d5a237c3)

## Interpretation of Sensitivity Analysis
- WACC Impact: A 1% reduction in WACC (from 6.24% to 5.24%) increases the share price by approximately 44% (from $360.22 to $518.94). Conversely, a 1% increase in WACC decreases the share price by approximately 23% (from $360.22 to $276.46). This demonstrates the significant impact of discount rates on valuation.
- Growth Rate Impact: Increasing the terminal growth rate from 3.00% to 4.00% raises the share price by approximately 39% (from $360.22 to $500.47). Reducing it to 2.00% decreases the share price by approximately 20% (from $360.22 to $286.20). This highlights the importance of long-term growth expectations in valuation.
- Combined Effects: The highest valuation ($900.43) occurs with the optimistic scenario of lower WACC (5.24%) and higher growth (4.00%), while the lowest valuation ($232.40) results from the conservative scenario of higher WACC (7.24%) and lower growth (2.00%).

# Key Investment Considerations
## Growth Drivers
1. E-commerce Expansion: Costco continues to invest in its online capabilities, enhancing its omnichannel presence.
2. International Expansion: Significant growth potential exists in markets like China, Japan, and Europe.
3. Membership Fee Increases: Historically implemented every 5-6 years, with the next increase potentially occurring in FY2025.
4. Private Label Growth: The Kirkland Signature brand continues to gain market share and drive margins.

## Risk Factors
1. Competitive Pressure: Increasing competition from Amazon, Walmart, and other warehouse clubs.
2. Margin Pressure: Rising labor and transportation costs could impact profitability.
3. Economic Sensitivity: Consumer spending patterns may change during economic downturns.
4. Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges could impact inventory availability and costs.

# Conclusion
Based on our DCF valuation, Costco Wholesale Corporation appears to be trading close to its fair value. The company's strong business model, consistent growth, and efficient operations support a positive long-term outlook. The implied share price of $360.22 represents our base case scenario with a WACC of 6.2% and terminal growth rate of 3.0%.

Costco's competitive advantages, including its membership model, efficient operations, and strong supplier relationships, position it well for continued success. While the company faces challenges from e-commerce competition and potential margin pressures, its track record of adaptation and focus on customer value proposition provide a strong foundation for future growth.
Investors should monitor key metrics including membership growth and renewal rates, same-store sales trends, and margin developments as indicators of Costco's ongoing performance.
